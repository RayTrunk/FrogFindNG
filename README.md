# FrogFindNG

FrogFindNG is a fork of [FrogFind](https://github.com/ActionRetro/FrogFind), designed to provide a simple and lightweight interface to access the modern web, optimized for various compatibility levels including retro and ultra-retro systems. It simplifies web content to make it accessible for older browsers and low-resource devices, while offering a clean and user-friendly experience.

## Features

- **Simplified Web Access**: Strips away complex elements (e.g., scripts, ads, navigation bars) to deliver clean, readable content.
- **Compatibility Modes**:
  - **Modern**: For contemporary browsers with full CSS and image support.
  - **Retro**: Optimized for older browsers like IE5/6 or Netscape 6.
  - **Ultra-Retro**: Text-only mode for extremely limited systems (e.g., Netscape 4, IE 3).
- **Dark Mode**: Optional dark theme for better readability in low-light conditions.
- **Search Integration**: Uses DuckDuckGo's HTML search for lightweight web searches.
- **Caching**: Implements Flask-Caching to store processed pages for 15 minutes, improving performance.
- **Customizable Interface**: Allows users to toggle compatibility modes and dark mode via a simple options panel.
